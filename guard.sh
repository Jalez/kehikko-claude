#!/bin/sh
#
# What a session this module started runs before each Bash command, its own or a subagent's: asks
# this module whether a module placed on the session's kehikko guards the command (protocol 2.61.0,
# see guards.ts), and prints what Claude Code is to do — run the module's command instead
# (`updatedInput`) or refuse with the module's reason (`permissionDecision: deny`).
#
#   /bin/sh guard.sh PreToolUse
#
# A hook of the session's own plugin (`hooks/hooks.json`, matcher Bash), beside context.sh and the
# same `kehikot/token`, `kehikot/stable`, `kehikot/origin` and `kehikot/registration`.
#
#   - Unlike context.sh, the hook's input leaves this script: the command is what is decided on. It
#     goes on a pipe to this module's own server on this computer, never on a command line, and the
#     module keeps none of it.
#   - The token goes to curl on a file descriptor, never on a command line.
#   - Loopback only, no proxy.
#   - Where it asks, in order: Kehikot's stable address for this module (`kehikot/stable`, the host's
#     `/m/<this module>`, which follows the module wherever it binds), what its registration names
#     now, and the origin it served on when the session started.
#   - Kehikot restarting is not a reason to skip the guards. While nothing answers (no connection,
#     or the host saying the module is not up: 502, 503, 504) it asks again every second for up to
#     20 seconds, so a heavy command is still sent to the queue once Kehikot is back. Only then does
#     the command run as written, with a note telling the agent it ran unguarded and how to queue
#     heavy work itself. While Kehikot stays away (`kehikot/away`, five minutes) the next commands
#     ask once and do not wait again.
#   - Every outcome is exit 0; an answer that is not this module's is nothing — the command then
#     runs as written.
#   - `KEHIKOT_DIRECT` set in the session's own environment is said (`direct=1`): it passes every guard.
