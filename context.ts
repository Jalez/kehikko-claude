/**
 * What a session this module started is told of where it is, without anybody typing anything:
 * its place, and the modules on its kehikko. And the session filed under that place, as
 * `/kehikot-here` would file it.
 *
 * ## How it is told
 *
 * The plugin a session is given (`sessionPlugin` in skills.ts) holds two hooks — `SessionStart`
 * and `UserPromptSubmit` — that run `context.sh`, which posts the session's id and its place token
 * to `POST /api/context` and prints what comes back. Claude Code gives the model what such a hook
 * prints as `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` (measured on 2.1.309 with a scratch config and
 * a stand-in for the model: "SessionStart hook additional context: …" in the system prompt, and
 * "UserPromptSubmit hook additional context: …" beside the prompt). Sessions started outside
 * Kehikot do not have the plugin, so none of this reaches them: assigning one is a person's say.
 *
 *  - **At every start** — a new conversation, one resumed or woken, one cleared or compacted —
 *    the whole of it: the place, and one line per module on the kehikko, with its MCP server's
 *    name in this session and its skills.
 *  - **At a prompt**, only what changed since the session was last told: modules put on the
 *    kehikko or taken off it, or the conversation moved to another place by the person. Nothing
 *    when nothing changed. What it was told is kept beside its doors (`toldFile`), so a restart of
 *    this module does not tell it twice.
 *
 * The modules are the host's to say (`modules` in its answer to `POST /host/place`, asked again
 * with the session's own token each time). A host too old to list them, or one that does not
 * answer, gets the place said and the modules left to `read_canvas`. What a module calls itself
 * and its one line are its own words: quoted, one line each, and said to be text.
 *
 * ## The filing
 *
 * A conversation this module started is filed under the place it was started at as soon as it is
 * a conversation — Claude Code holds a record of it — exactly as `/kehikot-here` files one: it
 * belongs there, and is that kehikko's own when the kehikko had none (`born`). `settle` in
 * live.ts does this while this process holds the run; the hook does it whatever happened to the
 * run in between (this module restarted, the view closed, the conversation cleared into a new
 * one). Never for a conversation the record already files somewhere — it stays where the person
 * put it — nor one a person took off its place (`detached`) or said is not a Kehikot one
 * (`ignored`).
