/**
 * The conversations connected to the kehikko on screen, said in two places:
 * a bar on the page when there are none, and a View menu in the container's
 * header when there are.
 *
 * ## Connected
 *
 * A conversation is connected to a kehikko (strictly: to its place — the
 * epic, the picked parts and the kehikko) when the record lists it there
 * (`places.json`). Exactly two things put it there, and neither is a guess:
 *
 *  - `/kehikot-here`, typed by the person in that conversation;
 *  - it is the conversation this container itself started (or moved on to,
 *    by `/resume` or `/clear` in it) — written once Claude Code has a record
 *    of it, which is when the person first says something in it.
 *
 * Nothing else connects one: no conversation of the project is offered or
 * picked here, and none started elsewhere is filed under a kehikko because
 * it happens to be running in the same folder.
 *
 * ## The bar
 *
 * With none connected the container still shows Claude Code — a fresh
 * conversation in the project's folder — and one slim line above it says
 * that nothing is connected and how to connect one (`NONE_CONNECTED`), with
 * the command to copy. It is not an Inbox item: it is about this container,
 * and is gone the moment the record lists one.
 *
 * ## The View menu
 *
 * A `switch` (protocol 1.1.0, `kehikot.header`): every conversation
 * connected here, the kehikko's own first, each with what it is doing, how
 * full its context window is, when it was last active and whether it is the
 * own one. Choosing one resumes it
 * in the container. Two runs go with it, for the one on screen: "Make this
 * the kehikko's own" (when it is not) and "Disconnect from this kehikko"
 * (a `confirm` run: the host arms it, and no agent may press it). The host
 * draws them in its View and Run menus and lays them out at every width.
